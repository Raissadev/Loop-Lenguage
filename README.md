# Loop-Lenguage

## :stop_sign: Attention!

This language is still under development!
I introduce everyone to the LOOP programming language. This language was created for study purposes only, but you are free to do what you want... 
For now it does not support recursion, much less object orientation and there are no arithmetic operations. But as I said earlier, it is still in development.
If you were curious about the name, I gave it that name because I got stuck in loops hahaha.
